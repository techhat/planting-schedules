Garden Planting Schedules
=========================

I have a number of different gardening books and websites that I refer to when
planning out my garden, and it's a pain. Wouldn't it be nicer if they were all
cross-referenced?

This is an attempt to cross-reference that information into one concise, easy-
to-use format. I won't standardize on anything just yet; the idea is to start
off by making a number of entries, and then adapting them all until something
reasonable has been reached.
